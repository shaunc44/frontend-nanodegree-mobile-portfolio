##**WEBSITE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**
###*UDACITY - FRONTEND NANODEGREE - PROJECT 4*
In this project I optimized a sample online portfolio for speed by 
improving the critical rendering path and making the pages render 
as quickly as possible. index.html achieved a PageSpeed score of 
93-mobile and 94-desktop. pizza.html has a frame rate higher than 
60 fps. Lastly, the time it takes to resize pizzas is now less than 5 ms.
